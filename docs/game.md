# Game Overview

Welcome to the Gryia experience. This page lays out the playable loop and where players should focus as the project grows.

## Pillars

- Exploration-first design that rewards curiosity.
- Tight combat with readable telegraphs.
- Meaningful progression that ties back to the world state.

## Core Systems

1. **Movement & Traversal** — sprinting, climbing, and short-range dashes to keep the pace quick.
2. **Combat Loop** — light/heavy attacks, parries, and ultimate abilities; stamina governs risk/reward.
3. **Progression** — experience feeds into skills and passive perks; gear augments playstyle.
4. **World State** — player choices shift faction strength and unlock new encounters.

## MVP Checklist

- Prototype a single explorable zone with a hub entrance.
- Implement one melee weapon archetype and a ranged option.
- Add a simple questline to demonstrate branching outcomes.
- Wire a save/load flow tied to player state and world state.

## Next Steps

- Outline the first three enemy families with strengths/weaknesses.
- Draft ability cooldown timings and resource costs.
- Define how co-op (if included) alters difficulty scaling.
